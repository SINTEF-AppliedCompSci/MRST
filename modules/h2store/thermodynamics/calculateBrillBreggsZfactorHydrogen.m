function Z = calculateBrillBreggsZfactorHydrogen(T, P)
% calculateBrillBeggsZfactorHydrogen  Computes the hydrogen density using the Brill and Beggs correlation.
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   rho = calculateBrillBeggsZfactorHydrogen(T, P)
%
% DESCRIPTION:
%   This function calculates the hydrogen density based on the Brill and Beggs
%   correlation, incorporating temperature (T) and pressure (P). The correlation
%   is derived from empirical coefficients specific to hydrogen gas properties.
%
% INPUTS:
%   T - Temperature in Kelvin (K)
%   P - Pressure in megapascals (MPa)
%
% OUTPUTS:
%   rho - Hydrogen density in kilograms per cubic meter (kg/m^3)
%
% REFERENCE:
%   Jafari Raad, Seyed Mostafa, Leonenko, Yuri, Hassanzadeh, Hassan, 2023.
%   Correlations for prediction of hydrogen gas viscosity and density for
%   production, transportation, storage, and utilization applications.
