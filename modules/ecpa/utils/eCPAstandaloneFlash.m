function [L, x, y, Z_L, Z_V, rhoL, rhoV, reports] = eCPAstandaloneFlash(p, T, z, EOSModel, varargin)
% Utility for flashing without explicitly forming a state

% SYNOPSIS:
%   [L, x, y, Z_L, Z_V] = eCPAstandaloneFlash(p, T, z, EOSModel)
%
% DESCRIPTION:
%   Wrapper function for solving a EOS flash without dealing with a state.
%
% PARAMETERS:
%   p   - Pressures as a column vector
%   T   - Temperatures as a column vector
%   z   - Composition as a matrix with number of rows equal to the number
%         of components.

% SEE ALSO:
%   `EquationOfStateModel`
