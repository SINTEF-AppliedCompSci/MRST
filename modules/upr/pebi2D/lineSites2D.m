function [CCPts, cGs, protPts,pGs] = lineSites2D(cellConstraints, CCGridSize, varargin) 
% Places sites along given lines.
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   [wellPts, wGs, protPts, pGs] = lineSites2D(F,faultGridSize)
%   [...] = lineSites2D(..., 'Name1', Value1, 'Name2', Value2,...)
%
% Parameters:
%   cellConstraints     - A cell of arrays. Each nx2 array in the cell contains 
%                   the piecewise linear approximation of a well. The 
%                   values must be sorted along the line, e.g., a well 
%                   consisting of two lines would be [x1,y1; x2,y2; x3,y3].
%                      .----------.-------------.
%                   (x1,y1)    (x2,y2)       (x3,y3)
%
%                   If an array has length 1 it is considered a point well.
%
%   CCGridSize    - Desired distance between sites along a well.
%                   The true distance is set such that it is a factor of 
%                   the total line length, and therefore might be slightly
%                   smaller than the desired distance.
%   
%   interpolateCC - OPTIONAL.
%                   Default value is a boolean false value, but the user
%                   can supply an individual value per line path. If false,
%                   each segment in the corresponding line curve will be
%                   represented by at least one cell. If true, the routine
%                   will interpolate along the curve, which means that
%                   sites will not necessarily fall exactly on the
%                   prescribed curve.
%
%   cfCut         - OPTIONAL.
%                   Default value array of zeros. Array of length equal the
%                   number of cell constraints. The value equals the output of the 
%                   function [~,~, cfCut] = splitAtInt2D. The value of 
%                   element i tells if the start or end site of constraint i 
%                   should be removed. If the value is 1 the end site is
%                   removed. If the value is 2 the start site is removed.
%                   If the value is 3 both the starts and end site is 
%                   removed.
%
%   wCut           - OPTIONAL.
%                   Default value array of zeros. Array of length equal the
%                   number of cell constraints. The value equals the output of the 
%                   function [~,wCut, ~] = splitAtInt2D. The value of 
%                   element i tells if the start or end site of well i 
%                   should be removed. If the value is 1 the end site is
%                   removed. If the value is 2 the start site is removed.
%                   If the value is 3 both the starts and end site is 
%                   removed.
%
%   sePtn         - OPTIONAL.
%                   Default value is an array of zeros, Array of length
%                   equal the number of cell constraints x 2 ([s,e]). Each row gives
%                   the start and end position of the constraint interpolation.
%                   The position is relative to the steplength. If
%                   s=ones(numel(cellConstraints),1) all constraints will start their
%                   first site one step length from the start of the
%                   constrained paths. Be careful when using both wfCut and sePts
%                   as the effects add up.
%
%   protLayer     - OPTIONAL.
%                   Default set to false. If set to true a protection layer
%                   is added on both sides of the cell constraints
%                   .          .             .  Protection Layer
%                                               protD(dist between sites)
%                   .----------.-------------.  constrained path
%
%                   .          .             .  Protection Layer
% 
%  protD          - OPTIONAL.
%                   Default value CCGridSize/10. Cell array of Functions.
%                   The array should have either one function or one 
%                   function for  each cell constraint.
%                   The functions give the distance from constrained sites 
%                   and protection sites. The function is evaluated along 
%                   the constraints such that protD(0) is the start of the 
%                   constraint while protD(1) is the end of the constraint.
%
% RETURNS:
%   CCPts           Array of all generated cell constriant sites.
%   cGs             Distance between consecutive cell constraint sites.
%   protPts         Array of generated protection sites.
%   pGs             Array with the distance between CCPts(i,:) and its
%                   protection Points
