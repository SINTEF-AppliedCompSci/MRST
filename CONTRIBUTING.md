# Contributing

Contributions are more than welcome using the fork and pull request approach 🙂 (if you are not familiar with this approach, please visit [_GitHub Docs PRs_](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests) for an extended documentation about collaborating with pull request; also, looking at previous merged pull requests helps to get familiar with this).

## Ground Rules

- We document our code
- We keep compatibility with Octave

## Contribute to the software

1. Work on your own fork of the main repo
1. Make sure the two scripts in the [_examples_](https://github.com/daavid00/ad-micp/examples) run with Octave (see the [_CI.yml_](https://github.com/daavid00/ad-micp/blob/main/.github/workflows/CI.yml) for the steps to run the first example)
1. Squash your commits into a single commit (see this [_nice tutorial_](https://gist.github.com/lpranam/4ae996b0a4bc37448dc80356efbca7fa) if you are not familiar with this)
1. Push your commit and make a pull request
1. The maintainers will review the pull request, and if the contribution is accepted, then it will be merge to the main repo 

## Reporting issues or problems

1. Issues or problems can be raised by creating a [_new issue_](https://github.com/daavid00/ad-micp/issues) in the repository GitHub page (if you are not familiar with this approach, please visit [_GitHub Docs Issues_](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues)).
1. We will try to answer as soon as possible, but also any user is more than welcome to answer. 

## Seek support

1. The preferred approach to seek support is to raise an issue as described in the previous lines.
1. We will try to answer as soon as possible, but also any user is more than welcome to answer.
- An alternative approach is to send an email to dmar@norceresearch.no.
