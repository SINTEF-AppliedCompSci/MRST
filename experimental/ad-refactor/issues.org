* Questions
** DONE Should we use ~setupSimComp~ or ~setupSimCompVE~?  In the original code, the comments argue for the former (see ~prepareSimulationSystem~), but right now I don't see a reason (and indeed, choosing the former gives wrong pore volumes).
- for now, I chose to use ~setupSimCompVE~ as this is conceptually the function to use for VE.

* stuff to do
** TODO profiling
** TODO saving of timesteps
** TODO implementing good plotting
** TODO comparing the three compressible models on the three paper cases
** 3D model
*** TODO implement 3D model
*** TODO Better grid for 3D model (tighter on top than on bottom)
*** TODO saving of timesteps for 3D model
*** TODO make good visualization of 3D model solution
*** TODO compare with 3D model






* scratch
** runScheduleRefactor
*** [nonlinear]solver.solveTimestep
**** model.stepFunction (called with the linear solver as an argument)
***** model.getEquations
***** [linear]solver.solveLinearProblem
***** model.updateState 
** What should the nonlinear solver do?
*** save/cache steps, and ability to load cached steps
*** set state.wellSol if control has changed


Endringer i runScheduleRefactor:
  - accept boundary conditions as argument
  - change getWell function
  - set state.wellsol
    - save/cache problematikk
