function [tbl, dispind] = sortIndexArray(tbl, fds, varargin)
%
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   tbl = sortIndexArray(tbl, fds, varargin)
%
% DESCRIPTION: . We use function sortrows to sort in increasing order the rows
% of indices given by the IndexArray tbl, following the order given by fds.
%
% PARAMETERS:
%   tbl      - IndexArray
%   fds      - Field names which give the order of the columns for the row
%              indexing sort
%   varargin - 
%
% KEYWORD ARGUMENTS:
%   keepAllFields - We keep all the fields for the table, even those that are
%                   not given in fds but belong to tbl. The default value is
%                   false. This option has not been properly tested and we
%                   recommend not using it for the moment.
%
% RETURNS:
%   tbl - IndexArray that has been sorted by rows.
%
% SEE ALSO: `IndexArray`, `crossIndexArray`, `projIndexArray`
%   `crossIndexArray`, `IndexArray`.
