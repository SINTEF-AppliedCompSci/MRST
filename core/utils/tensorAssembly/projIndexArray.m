function [projtbl, indstruct] = projIndexArray(tbl, fds)
%
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   function projtbl = projIndexArray(tbl, fds)
%
% DESCRIPTION: Project an IndexArray on a subset of indices, meaning that given
% an IndexArray tbl with field tbl.A and tbl.B. If we project on the index name
% 'A', we construct an IndexArray projtbl with field projtbl.A such that, for
% all i, there exists a unique j such that tbl.A(i) = projtbl.A(j).
%
% The indices in projtbl are sorted with respect to order given in fds.
%
% PARAMETERS:
%   tbl - IndexArray
%   fds - field names along which we project. Syntax is {'A1', 'A2'} for example
%
% RETURNS:
%   projtbl - projected IndexArray
%
% SEE ALSO: `IndexArray`, `crossIndexArray`, `sortIndexArray`
%   `crossIndexArray`, `IndexArray`.
