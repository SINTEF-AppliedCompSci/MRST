function grad = computeGradientPerturbationAD(state0, model, schedule, getObjective, varargin)
%Compute gradients using finite difference approximation by perturbing controls
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   grad = computeGradientPerturbationAD(state0, model, schedule, getObjective)
%
% DESCRIPTION:
%   For a given schedule, compute gradients with regards to well controls
%   by perturbing all controls ever so slightly and re-running the
%   simulation.
%  
%   As the cost of this routine grows is approximately ::
%
%        (# wells)x(# ctrl step) x cost of schedule
%
%   it can be potentially extremely expensive. It is better to use the
%   `computeGradientAdjointAD` routine for most practical purposes. This
%   routine is primarily designed for validation of said routine.
%
% REQUIRED PARAMETERS:
%
%   state0       - Physical model state at `t = 0`
%
%   model        - Subclass of `PhysicalModel` class such as
%                  `ThreePhaseBlackOilModel` that models the physical 
%                  effects we want to study.
%
%   schedule     - Schedule suitable for `simulateScheduleAD`.
%
%   getObjective - Function handle for getting objective function value 
%                  from a set of wellSols. 
%                  Function handle format: `@(globVars, states, schedule)`
%
% OPTIONAL PARAMETERS:
%   
%  'Verbose'        - Indicate if extra output is to be printed such as
%                     detailed convergence reports and so on. 
% 
%  'scaling'        - Struct with fields `rate` and `pressure` used to
%                     scale the numerical perturbation.
%
%  'perturbation'   - Magnitude of perturbation. Default `1e-7`.
%
%
% RETURNS:
%   grad - Gradients for each step.
%
% SEE ALSO:
%   `computeGradientAdjointAD`, `simulateScheduleAD`
