classdef AGMGSolverAD < LinearSolverAD
    % Linear solver that calls external compiled multigrid solver
    %
    % SYNOPSIS:
    %   solver = AGMGSolverAD()
    %
    % DESCRIPTION:
    %   This solver calls the AGMG package and supports setup/cleanup of the
    %   multigrid solver for multiple solves of the same problem.
    %
    % NOTE:
    %    This solver requires AGMG to be installed and working.
    %
    % SEE ALSO:
    %   `BackslashSolverAD`

   properties
       setupDone % Internal book-keeping variable
       reuseSetup % Will reuse the setup phase to improve speed for e.g. a GMRES loop with the same matrix system. However, some systems report segfaults with this option enabled.
       singleApply = false; % Just apply the preconditioner once, do not solve to tolerance
   end
