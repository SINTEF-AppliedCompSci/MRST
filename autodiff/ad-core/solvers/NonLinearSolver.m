classdef NonLinearSolver < handle
    %Generalized Newton-like nonlinear solver
    %
    % SYNOPSIS:
    %   solver = NonLinearSolver()
    %
    %   solver = NonLinearSolver('maxIterations', 5)
    %
    % DESCRIPTION:
    %   The NonLinearSolver class is a general non-linear solver based on
    %   Newton's method. It is capable of timestep selection and cutting based
    %   on convergence rates and can be extended via subclassing or modular
    %   linear solvers and timestep classes.
    %
    %   Convergence is handled by the PhysicalModel class. The NonLinearSolver
    %   simply responds based on what the model reports in terms of convergence
    %   to ensure some level of encapsulation.
    %
    % REQUIRED PARAMETERS:
    %   None.
    %
    % RETURNS:
    %   A NonLinearSolver class instance ready for use.
