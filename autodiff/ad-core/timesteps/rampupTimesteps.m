function dT = rampupTimesteps(time, dt, n)
% Create timesteps that ramp up geometrically
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   dT = rampupTimesteps(1*year, 30*day)
%   dT = rampupTimesteps(1*year, 30*day, 5)
%
% DESCRIPTION:
%   This function generates a timestep sequence for a given total time
%   interval that increases geometrically until it reaches some target
%   timestep. The rest of the interval is then divided into a number of
%   target timesteps.
%
% REQUIRED PARAMETERS:
%   time   - The total simulation time so that sum(dt) = time
%
%   dt     - Target timestep after initial ramp-up
%
%   n      - (OPTIONAL) Number of rampup steps. Defaults to 8.
%
% RETURNS:
%   dt     - Array of timesteps.
%
% NOTE:
%   The final timestep may be shorter than dt in order to exactly reach T.
