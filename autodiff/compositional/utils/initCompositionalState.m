function state = initCompositionalState(model, p, T, s0, z0, eos)
% Initialize a compositional state given initial composition
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   state = initCompositionalState(model, p, T, s0, z0)
%
% PARAMETERS:
%   model - Compositional model, or the reservoir grid itself.
%   p     - Pressures as a column vector
%   T     - Temperatures as a column vector
%   s0    - Initial saturation. Any compositional phases will be flashed, so
%           in that case only the sum matters. Only required for more than
%           two phases present.
%   z     - Composition as a matrix with number of rows equal to the number
%           of components.
%   eos   - EquationOfStateModel instance if model is not the first input
%           argument (legacy syntax). Otherwise optional.
%
% RETURNS:
%   state - Intialized state (after flash)
