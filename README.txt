The ad-micp module extends the solvers found in ad-core and ad-blackoil with capability for simulating microbially induced calcite precipitation (MICP) applications. MICP is a new and sustainable technology which utilizes biochemical processes to create barriers by calcium carbonate cementation; therefore, this technology has a potential to be used for sealing leakage zones in geological formations. The main mechanisms in the conceptual model are as follow: microbial solution is injected which results in microbes attaching themselves to the pore walls to form biofilm, growth solution is injected to stimulate the development of biofilm, cementation solution is injected which is used by the biofilm for production of calcite, and the calcite reduce the pore space which in turn decreases the rock permeability.

Further information on the mathematical model can be found in the two following publications:
