function p3D = pVE_to_p3D(Gt, pVE, fluid)
% Convert from upscaled pressure to fine-scale pressure.
%   
% SYNOPSIS:
%   p3D = pVE_to_p3D(Gt, pVE, fluid)
% 
% PARAMETERS:
%   Gt    - the top surface grid on which the upscaled pressure field is defined 
%   pVE   - the upscaled (2D) pressure field, representing the pressure at the 
%           caprock level
%   fluid - the VE fluid object used during simulation (needed here to
%           compute brine density).
%
% RETURNS:
%   p3D - reconstructed 3D pressure field, defined on the original 3D grid
%         domain (found in Gt.parent).
