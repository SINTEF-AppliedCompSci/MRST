**** paper1
**** paper2
**** paper3
*** DONE Go through co2lab-ad, reorganise (move to deprecated or elsewhere)
*** Placement of the new code in appropriate places
*** Document new code
*** Write READMEs for all the papers
*** Delint
*** Address all @@
** Decide how to deal with the CO2 object, CoolProps and data files
** Finish off code for paper3 (at least what there is time for)
** Incorporate Olav's changes
** Run through all examples once more

*** TODO *Convergence issues for rate-driven dissolution model*


** Other:
- the script 'dissolutionTopSurfaceExample1' doesn't seem to converge properly, and isn't used for any of the illustrations as far as I can see, so it is left out from the final compilation.
